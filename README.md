# Rust-55

Smithing a sword is a paramount task. You must prepare your materials, design your sword, heat the steel, shape the sword and so many more steps; but with grasp, practice and precision, you can forge beautiful masterpieces. If you think of it, it's a simple algorithm. But, in order to become a blacksmith, you firstly need to be the apprentice.

In Rust-55 you will not learn how to smith a sword, but to code in a beautiful, low-level programming language... **Rust!** It is the perfect tool to build robust, efficient and safe applications; and of course, with enough consistency, you might become the blacksmith to build the next big thing!

Cheers!
